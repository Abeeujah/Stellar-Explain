# Stellar Explain 🌍✨

**Stellar Explain** is an open-source tool that makes Stellar blockchain transactions human-readable.  
It decodes raw transaction data into plain English, helping both developers and everyday users understand who sent what, when, and why.  

## Structure
- **packages/core** → Rust backend (transaction parser & REST API)  
- **packages/ui** → Next.js frontend for displaying decoded transactions  
- **docs** → Project documentation & guides  

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StellarCommons/stellar-explain.git
   cd stellar-explain
